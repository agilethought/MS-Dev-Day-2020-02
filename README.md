# AgileThought MS Dev Day Workshop

## Context

Today, we'll be discussing and developing an Azure DevOps pipeline wrapped around an Azure MLOps pipeline to proactively scale a Kubernetes cluster based on Machine Learning predictions.

At the end of the workshop, your Azure account will contain a working instance of this configuration for reference and experimentation.

We have included three Azure DevOps "challenges" over the course the workshop.  We will update this documentation with solutions to these challenges as we go.
